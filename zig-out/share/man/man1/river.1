river - dynamic tiling Wayland compositor
.PP
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBriver\fR [\fIoptions\fR]
.PP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBriver\fR is a dynamic tiling Wayland compositor.\& Window management is based on
a stack of views laid out dynamically by an external layout generator.\& Tags
are used instead of workspaces allowing for increased flexibility.\&
.PP
All configuration and control happens at runtime through Wayland protocols,
including several river-specific protocol extensions.\& The \fBriverctl\fR(1)
utility may be used to communicate with river over these protocols.\&
.PP
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
\fB-h\fR
.RS 4
Print a help message and exit.\&
.PP
.RE
\fB-version\fR
.RS 4
Print the version number and exit.\&
.PP
.RE
\fB-c\fR \fIshell_command\fR
.RS 4
Override the default search paths for an init executable: instead
\fIshell_command\fR will be run with \fI/bin/sh -c\fR.\& See the \fBCONFIGURATION\fR
section for more details.\&
.PP
.RE
\fB-log-level\fR [\fBerror\fR|\fBwarning\fR|\fBinfo\fR|\fBdebug\fR]
.RS 4
Set the log level of river.\& At the \fBerror\fR log level, only errors
are logged.\&  At the \fBdebug\fR log level, everything is logged including
verbose debug messages.\&
.PP
.RE
\fB-no-xwayland\fR
.RS 4
Disable xwayland at runtime even if river has been built with support.\&
.PP
.RE
.SH CONFIGURATION
.PP
On startup river will run an executable file at $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/river/init if
such an executable exists.\& If $XDG_CONFIG_HOME is not set, ~/.\&config/river/init
will be used instead.\&
.PP
The executable init file will be run as a process group leader after river'\&s
Wayland server is initialized but before entering the main loop.\& On exit,
river will send SIGTERM to this process group.\&
.PP
Usually this executable is a shell script invoking \fBriverctl\fR(1) to create
mappings, start programs such as a layout generator or status bar, and
perform other configuration.\&
