rivertile - tiled layout generator for river
.PP
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBrivertile\fR [\fIoptions\fR]
.PP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBrivertile\fR is a layout generator for \fBriver\fR(1).\& It provides a simple tiled
layout with split main/secondary stacks.\& The initial state may be configured
with various options passed on startup.\& Some values may additionally be
modified while rivertile is running with the help of \fBriverctl\fR(1).\&
.PP
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
\fB-h\fR
.RS 4
Print a help message and exit.\&
.PP
.RE
\fB-version\fR
.RS 4
Print the version number and exit.\&
.PP
.RE
\fB-view-padding\fR \fIpixels\fR
.RS 4
Set the padding around views in pixels.\& (Default: 6)
.PP
.RE
\fB-outer-padding\fR \fIpixels\fR
.RS 4
Set the padding around the edge of the layout area in pixels.\&
(Default: 6)
.PP
.RE
\fB-main-location\fR [\fBtop\fR|\fBbottom\fR|\fBleft\fR|\fBright\fR]
.RS 4
Set the initial location of the main area in the layout.\&
(Default: \fBleft\fR)
.PP
.RE
\fB-main-count\fR \fIcount\fR
.RS 4
Set the initial number of views in the main area of the
layout.\& (Default: 1)
.PP
.RE
\fB-main-ratio\fR \fIratio\fR
.RS 4
Set the initial ratio of the main area to total layout area.\& The
\fIratio\fR must be between 0.\&1 and 0.\&9, inclusive.\& (Default: 0.\&6)
.PP
.RE
.SH COMMANDS
.PP
These commands may be sent to rivertile at runtime with the help of
\fBriverctl\fR(1).\&
.PP
\fBmain-location\fR [\fBtop\fR|\fBbottom\fR|\fBleft\fR|\fBright\fR]
.RS 4
Set the location of the main area in the layout.\&
.PP
.RE
\fBmain-count\fR \fIvalue\fR
.RS 4
Set or modify the number of views in the main area of the layout.\& If
\fIvalue\fR is prefixed by a +/- sign, \fIvalue\fR is added/subtracted from the
current count.\& If there is no sign, the main count is set to \fIvalue\fR.\&
Note that the main count cannot be decreased below 1.\&
.PP
.RE
\fBmain-ratio\fR \fIvalue\fR
.RS 4
Set or modify the ratio of the main area to total layout area.\& If
\fIvalue\fR is prefixed by a +/- sign, \fIvalue\fR is added/subtracted from
the current ratio.\& If there is no sign, the main ratio is set to
\fIvalue\fR.\& Note that the ratio will always be clamped to the range
0.\&1 to 0.\&9.\&

.RE
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
Start \fBrivertile\fR with 4 pixels outer padding and the \fBtop\fR main location:
.PP
.RS 4
rivertile -outer-padding 4 -main-location top
.PP
.RE
Increase the main ratio by 0.\&1 at runtime:
.PP
.RS 4
riverctl send-layout-cmd rivertile "main-ratio +0.\&1"
.PP
.RE
Set the main count to 3 at runtime:
.PP
.RS 4
riverctl send-layout-cmd rivertile "main-count 3"
